/* JSP stands for Java Servlet Pages
 * 
 * it makes easier to work with begger and complex web pages
 * 
 * DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JSP AND SERVLET
 * in servlet you can write the html code inside the java code which might become super messy for bigger projects
 * in jsp we we write the java code inside the html code which is way more easier and efficient
 * 
 * JSP will give you the REQUESTS and RESPONSE objects so you dont have to initiate them
 * alo jsp gives you the object of PRINTWRITER just say out.println() and you are good to go
 * 
 * 
 *  TO WORK WITH JSP
 *  simply create a jsp file
 *  isnide it will be some html code if not write yourself damn it hhh
 *  then you should write the java code inside this <% hereJavaCode %>
 *  
 *  TO CALL JSP FILE IN HTML FILE
 *  simply in the FORM tag of html write the JSP file name and you are good to go
 *
